## API Documentation
The Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for QuestionnairesCompiler is provided in two YAML files located in the repository:

`questionnaires_compiler/docs/questionnaires-compiler.openapi.yaml`: This file contains the full API documentation. 
It covers:
* `Management APIs` Endpoints used for administrative tasks.
* `Verification APIs` Endpoints handling core application use cases like email and phone validation.
* `Backoffice APIs` Endpoints related to backend functionality, particularly for the frontend to interact with.

:warning: `questionnaires_compiler/docs/openapi_integrators.yaml`: This file contains a subset of APIs specifically intended for integrators. It only includes the endpoints required to implement the use cases without exposing internal or management-related APIs.


## Development:

### Setting Up and Running QuestionnairesCompiler

To build and launch QuestionnairesCompiler, run the following commands:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

Apply migrations
``` bash
docker-compose exec questionnaires_compiler python manage.py migrate
```


### Before Release:

To prepare for a new release, use the following command to automatically update the changelog and increment the semantic version:

```bash
git changelog all --bump scripts/scripts_bumping_version.sh
```

#### What It Does:
* Generates Changelog: Updates the changelog based on commit history.
* Bumps Version: Updates the semantic version according to changes (major, minor, or patch).

#### :warning: Warnings:
* Automatic Commit: This command will automatically commit the changes.
* Tag Creation: It creates a new version tag.
* Pushes Changes: It pushes the commit and tag to the remote repository.

:warning: Ensure your working directory is clean before running this command.


## Usage

After configuring and starting QuestionnairesCompiler, follow these steps to use the application to compile questionnaire.
## TODO: continue
### Step 1: Create an Organization
First, create an organization to manage the identity verification requests. Use the following curl command:

```bash
curl --insecure --location --request POST 'https://localhost/api/v1/organization' \
--header 'X-API-KEY: 1234' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "id": "onboarding-test",
  "name": "onboarding-test",
  "enabled": true,
  "tokens": [
    {
      "token": "328e5cca-3ba9-46fd-b95d-f7a970bfadc0",
      "label": "onboarding-test"
    }
  ]
}'
```

This will create a new organization with the ID and token provided. You'll use this token in future requests for authentication.

### Step 2: Create a Verification Request
Now, initiate an identity verification request by submitting the userâ€™s information. Use the following curl command:

```bash
curl --insecure --location --request POST 'https://localhost/api/v1/identity-verification' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer 328e5cca-3ba9-46fd-b95d-f7a970bfadc0' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "id": "51c0cf5b-fc88-41e5-b819-f69977cad4e3",
  "firstName": "Gennaro",
  "lastName": "Bellavista",
  "email": "u1kcmk+3qd5di0evbris@sharklasers.com",
  "phone": "+39334125874",
  "ip": "158.201.181.244",
  "webhookUrl": "https://webhook.site/b0ce340e-1988-4dcb-8285-65b7037885d9"
}'
```

### Step 3: Receive the Validation Result
After submitting the verification request, you can wait for service to send the validation result to the provided webhookUrl.

Alternatively, you can poll the resource to check the status of the identity verification request using this curl command:

```bash
curl --insecure --location --request GET 'https://localhost/api/v1/identity-verification/51c0cf5b-fc88-41e5-b819-f69977cad4e3' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer 328e5cca-3ba9-46fd-b95d-f7a970bfadc0'
```

## Testing:

### Automating Testing with GitLab CI/CD
When a new branch is pushed to a repository, it automatically triggers the GitLab CI pipeline. Within this setup, a specifically configured GitLab runner is tasked with executing the test suite, which is stored under app/test/tests.


### Manual Testing


#### Option 1: Containerized Test Suite

To leverage a containerized version of the test suite for ease and consistency across environments, follow the steps below:


1. Execute the Test Suite:

   * Navigate to the project's root directory.
   * Run the following command in your terminal to start the test execution: 
   ```bash 
   bash ./scripts/run_tests.sh
   ```

#### Option 2: Local Python Interpreter

For those who prefer or need to run tests locally using their Python environment, the following steps will guide you through the setup and execution process:

1. Install Application Requirements:
   * Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   * Install the application's requirements by navigating to the app directory and running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r questionnaires_compiler/requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://pypi.intranet.bit4id.com/simple
   
   ```
   * Install the test-specific requirements found in app/test:
   ```bash
   pip install -r questionnaires_compiler/test/requirements-test.txt

   ```
2. Set Environment Variable:

      Before running the tests, override the necessary environment variables stored in  `questionnaires_compiler/test/pytest.ini`
   
3. Execute Tests:
   With the environment configured, you can now run the tests using your local Python interpreter. Navigate to the app/test directory and execute the desired test scripts directly or use a test runner like pytest.
